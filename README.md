This repository contains files for my master thesis at University of Wroclaw. Title of thesis is: "Gra "zgadnij automat"" and it is written in Polish language. Project is in progress.

# Project aim:
Aim of this project is to create a game in which player will have to guess an automata (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite-state_machine) using some hints for this automaton. The game will be a mobile app written in the Python language (https://www.python.org/) using Kivy framework (https://kivy.org/#home).

# Launching the project:
Project is already launchable. You can launch it by installing Python(https://www.python.org/downloads/) and Kivy (https://kivy.org/doc/stable/gettingstarted/installation.html) and running file Game.py. 

# Project structure:
Files DFA.py, VPA.py and WFA.py contain definition of automatas. File DFA.py contatins definition of Deterministic finite automaton (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deterministic_finite_automaton) and Nondeterministic finite automaton (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nondeterministic_finite_automaton). File VPA.py contains definition of Deterministic visibly pushdown automaton (https://www.csa.iisc.ac.in/~deepakd/atc-common/vpa-stoc04.pdf). File WFA.py contains definitions of weighted automaton (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weighted_automaton). Files Game.py and Game.kv contain definition of application interface.
