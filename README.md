This repository contains files for my master thesis at University of Wroclaw. Title of thesis is: "Gra "zgadnij automat"" and it is written in Polish language. Project is in progress.

# Project aim:
Aim of this project is to create a game in which player will have to guess an automata (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite-state_machine) using some hints for this automaton.

# Project status:
For now the project contains only backend part of the application. Files DFA.py, NFA.py, PDA.py contain classes representing (respectively): deterministic finite automaton (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deterministic_finite_automaton), nondeterministic finite automaton (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nondeterministic_finite_automaton), pushdown automaton(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pushdown_automaton). Files Game_XXX.py contain classes for games with given type of automata. For example file Game_DFA.py contains class representing game for DFAs. 

# Usage:
Project is now not launchable (it will become launchable after creation of frontend part).
