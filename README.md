This repository contains files for my master thesis at University of Wroclaw. Title of thesis is: "Gra "zgadnij automat"" and it is written in Polish language. Project is in progress.

# Project aim:
Aim of this project is to create a game in which player will have to guess an automata (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite-state_machine) using some hints for this automaton.

# Project status:
For now the project contains only backend part of the application and is not launchable (project will become launchable, after creation of frontend part).
